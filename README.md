# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
In this endeavor, we acquired the skill to identify emotions expressed in speech. Employing an MLPClassifier, we utilized the soundfile library to read the audio files, and the librosa library to extract relevant features. The resultant model achieved an accuracy level of approximately 74%, which meets our satisfactory threshold for performance.
